# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for the task.
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase.

5. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing the external behavior.
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools. Target: >80% coverage for new code.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation

8. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g, `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator`.
   - Perform the commit.

9. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **Step 9.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
   - **Step 9.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task. **Shell safety:** Note content MUST NOT contain backticks (`` ` ``) or triple backticks. They break shell quoting. Use plain text descriptions instead of markdown code fences.
   - **Step 9.3: Attach Note:**
       1. **Create the file first:** Use `echo "NOTE_CONTENT" > temp_note.txt` to create the file
       2. **Then add the note:** Use `git notes add -F temp_note.txt <commit_hash>`
       3. **Clean up:** Delete with `rm temp_note.txt`
       ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Do NOT assume files exist. You MUST explicitly create them with `echo` before using the `-F` flag. The UI may show "(new)" markers that do NOT mean the file actually exists on disk.

10. **Get and Record Task Commit SHA:**
    - **Step 10.1: Re-read Plan:** You MUST re-read `plan.md` **from disk** before editing. Do NOT rely on cached or in-memory content from earlier in the session — the file changes after every task.
    - **Step 10.2: Update Plan:** Find the completed task, update from `[~]` to `[x]`, append first 7 chars of commit hash.
    - **Step 10.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

11. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - Stage `plan.md` and commit with message like `conductor(plan): Mark task 'Create user model' as complete`.

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** Executed immediately after a task that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start.**

2.  **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
    -   Determine Phase Scope via git commit SHAs.
    -   List changed files with `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD`.
    -   Verify and create tests for each code file.

3.  **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
    -   Announce exact shell command before execution.
    -   If tests fail, attempt fix max 2 times, then ask user.

4.  **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan.**

5.  **Await Explicit User Feedback:** Do not proceed without user confirmation.

6.  **Create Checkpoint Commit:** `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`.

7.  **Attach Verification Report using Git Notes.**

8.  **Record Phase Checkpoint SHA in plan.md:** You MUST re-read `plan.md` **from disk** before editing — do NOT rely on cached or in-memory content. Find the heading for the completed phase and append the checkpoint SHA.

9.  **Commit Plan Update:** `conductor(plan): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`.

10. **Announce Completion.**

### Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines
- [ ] All public functions/methods are documented
- [ ] Type safety is enforced
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors
- [ ] Works correctly on mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. All code implemented to specification
2. Unit tests written and passing
3. Code coverage meets project requirements
4. Documentation complete (if applicable)
5. Code passes all configured linting and static analysis checks
6. Works beautifully on mobile (if applicable)
7. Implementation notes added to `plan.md`
8. Changes committed with proper message
9. Git note with task summary attached to the commit
